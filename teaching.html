					<p class="text-weight-bold space-between"> Constitutive Material Modelling (7015ENG) </p>
					Current progress in the field of mechanics is mostly because of the developments in manufacturing
					and innovations in new materials, e.g., metamaterials and liquid crystals. Most of the current
					research in Structural and Mechanical Engineering is devoted to accurate modelling of material
					behaviour. These progresses require formulating constitutive material models to capture the response
					of the structure accurately. The essential tool for formulating the constitutive behaviour is
					Continuum Mechanics (CM). CM provides the required formulation of continuous media (e.g., solids and
					fluids) under external stimuli (e.g., mechanical loads, thermal variations, electromagnetic fields,
					etc). With the provided theory, kinematics and equilibrium equations are shared between most
					materials and the only required part would be the material model. Obtaining a deep understanding of
					CM requires some mathematical tools without which a complete picture of the subject is lost. Tensor
					algebra is an abstract tool which unlocks a deep understanding of various field theories including
					continuum mechanics. This course provides the foundation for understanding material models in
					engineering. Elementary tensor calculus and continuum mechanics will be used to understand the
					formulation of constitutive material models. After understanding the role and context of each
					material model, calibration of models using experimental data will be discussed. The provided
					fundamental knowledge will be essential for many practical courses like computational
					statics/dynamics, computational fluid dynamics, nonlinear finite element analysis.
					<p>The following topics are covered in this course:
					<ol class="enum-list flex-gap-1">
						<li>Mathematical preliminaries (operator and set theories),</li>
						<li>Tensor algebra and calculus, </li>
						<li>Kinematics of Cauchy continua, </li>

					The finite element method is regarded nowadays as the standard tool to solve engineering problems in
					the
					industrial and academic context. A significant contribution to the success of this method is based
					on the
					development of powerful computer hard and software during the last decades. Many user-friendly
					commercial
					packages are available which allow the numerical treatment of real engineering problems on personal
					computers
					or
					even notebooks. The method itself integrates the basic knowledge of engineering materials,
					mathematics,
					mechanics (statics and dynamics), computing and programming, and computer-aided design that students
					would
					acquire in the first two years of their undergraduate studies. The problem of determining forces and
					displacements, stresses and strains or the vibrational behaviour is fundamental to many applied
					areas of
					mechanical engineering including transportation (automotive, aviation, or naval structures) or plant
					engineering. This course presents continuum mechanical basics and computational algorithms that are
					used to
					analyse engineering components and structures under arbitrary loading conditions. Furthermore,
					students will
					gain skills in the use of a state-of-the-art finite element analysis package to further deepen their
					knowledge
					in the areas of stress/strain analysis and dynamical behaviour. However, only who thoroughly
					understands the
					finite element theory, concepts and involved algorithms will be able to obtain reliable and
					realistic results
					from this powerful method. The ability to critically analyse and interpret numerically obtained
					results is a
					prerequisite for the responsible application of this method in any engineering field.
