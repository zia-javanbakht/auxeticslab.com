				<p>The following topics are covered in this course:
				<ol class="enum-list flex-gap-1">
					<li>Introduction to Engineering Materials, </li>
					<li>Atomic Structure and Interatomic Bonding, </li>
					<li>Structure of Crystalline Solids, </li>
					<li>Properties of Metals, </li>
					<li>Failure of metals </li>
					<li>Metallurgy basics</li>
					<li>Ceramics, </li>
					<li>Polymers, </li>
					<li>Composites, </li>
					<li>Corrosion and Degradation,</li>
					<li>Electrical Properties of Materials, and</li>
					<li>Literature review workshop.</li>
				</ol>

				The course considers the fundamental properties of metals and non-metallic materials. Students are introduced
				to
				the atomic and microstructure of materials and their relationship to mechanical and electrical properties. The
				course explores the mechanical concepts of stress, strain, elongation and material failure (including testing)
				and the phenomenon of electrical conduction. See the <a class="link-external-simple"

				The finite element method is regarded nowadays as the standard tool to solve engineering problems in the
				industrial and academic context. A significant contribution to the success of this method is based on the
				development of powerful computer hard and software during the last decades. Many user-friendly commercial
				packages are available which allow the numerical treatment of real engineering problems on personal computers
				or
				even notebooks. The method itself integrates the basic knowledge of engineering materials, mathematics,
				mechanics (statics and dynamics), computing and programming, and computer-aided design that students would
				acquire in the first two years of their undergraduate studies. The problem of determining forces and
				displacements, stresses and strains or the vibrational behaviour is fundamental to many applied areas of
				mechanical engineering including transportation (automotive, aviation, or naval structures) or plant
				engineering. This course presents continuum mechanical basics and computational algorithms that are used to
				analyse engineering components and structures under arbitrary loading conditions. Furthermore, students will
				gain skills in the use of a state-of-the-art finite element analysis package to further deepen their knowledge
				in the areas of stress/strain analysis and dynamical behaviour. However, only who thoroughly understands the
				finite element theory, concepts and involved algorithms will be able to obtain reliable and realistic results
				from this powerful method. The ability to critically analyse and interpret numerically obtained results is a
				prerequisite for the responsible application of this method in any engineering field. See the <a
