				<p class="text-weight-bold">On Thermal Strains and Residual Stresses in the Linear Theory of Anti-sandwiches</p>
				<p>
					The current study aims to formulate the behaviour of anti-sandwiches that considers residual stresses and
					thermal strains by means of a layer-wise approach. To this end, the constitutive equations of classical linear
					elasticity are extended to form the Duhamel-Neumann equations. The direct approach is adopted to project the
					three-dimensional problem onto two-dimensional surfaces, i.e., each layer of the anti-sandwich is modelled as
					a single surface that represents the overall behaviour of the layer. The formulation of the problem begins
					with the decoupling of deformation into independent membrane, bending, twisting and transverse shear modes.
					The infinitesimal deformation measures are set up on the kinematics of the problem and related to the
					corresponding kinetic measures via the proposed stiffness relations. The resulting boundary value problem is
					converted into the equivalent weak form by means of a variational approach. The presented set of equations can
					be solved inexpensively using various computational approaches such as the finite element method.

				<p class="text-weight-bold">Modelling Additively Manufactured Parts Using Direct FE²</p>
				<p>
					This study challenges the Direct FE² to model voids in additively manufactured parts. Some polylactic acid
					(PLA) tensile coupons—without any voids and with 23% voids—were manufactured using fused deposition modelling
					(FDM) and tested under monotonic loading. An inhouse Python script was developed to implement the modelling
					steps of Direct FE² in Abaqus commercial package. A homogenised medium was used in conventional finite element
					(FE) method whereas discrete modelling of voids was adopted in Direct FE². Despite using the same isotropic
					elastoplastic material model with progressive damage, the response of Direct FE² was noticeably softer.
					Although stress concentration around the voids were illustrated in Direct FE², high error values demand
					further refinements in selecting the representative volume. The applications of this approach can be extended
					to modelling defects in other complex parts such as auxetic/sandwich structures and composites.

				<p class="text-weight-bold">Finite Element Analysis of Natural Fibre Composites Using a Self-Updating Model</p>
				<p>
					The aim of the current work was to illustrate the effect of the fibre area correction factor on the results of
					modelling natural fibre-reinforced composites. A mesoscopic approach is adopted to represent the stochastic
					heterogeneity of the composite, i.e., a meso-structural numerical model was prototyped using the finite
					element method including quasi-unidirectional discrete fibre elements embedded in a matrix. The model was
					verified by the experimental results from previous work on jute fibres but is extendable to every natural
					fibre with cross-sectional non-uniformity. A correction factor was suggested to fine-tune both the analytical
					and numerical models. Moreover, a model updating technique for considering the size-effect of fibres is
					introduced and its implementation was automated by means of FORTRAN subroutines and Python scripts. It was
					shown that correcting and updating the fibre strength is critical to obtain accurate macroscopic response of
					the composite when discrete modelling of fibres is intended. Based on the findings of the current study,
					considering the effect of flaws on the strength of natural fibres and the fibre area correction factor are
					crucial to obtain realistic results.

				<p class="text-weight-bold"> Analyitcal Models for Plastic Behaviour of Rotating Squares</p>
				<p>
					Auxetic structures are emerging as a topic of interest due to their tunable properties for different
					conditions. Such structures have negative Poisson's ratio as a result of their internal structures and their
					deformation mechanism at nano or micro levels when uniaxially loaded. Previous studies have demonstrated high
					energy absorption, increased shear strength, increased plane strain fracture toughness and a high indentation
					resistance for such structures and materials. These properties make auxetics a prime fit for energy absorbing
					structures. For this particular arragnement, the rotating squares, it is hypothesised that due to
					concentration of stresses in the hinges, it is a safe assumption to consider the squares perfectly rigid even
					in large deformations; however in the hinges, the stretch mechanism starts to dominate as the rotation angle
					increases. Therefore, it is assumed that rigid square elements rotate about stretchable corner hinges. In this
					ongoing research, the additional DoF was included into the analytical model and the deformation response was
					restated consisting
					of both translational and rotational stiffness of the hinges. Later, the effect of introduced DoF was
					investigated in finite element models for different hinge stiffnesses. The main idea is to extend the
					relations to plastic behaviour with an attempt to improve energy dissipation.
